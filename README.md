# Robot_Project
This repo focuses on the implementation details of a project based on the Human Machine Interface(HMI) device. We developed a hand tracking pose system using Intelâ€™s RealSense Sensor. The system is designed to accurately capture and track the movements of the human hand and gestures in real-time, enabling intuitive and natural interaction with virtual environments using Mediapipe model. The camera calibration is done to capture projected screen accurately. The human hand is an incredible gift that enables us to interactwith the world around us. However, for some individuals, hand mobility may be impaired due to disabilities. This is where we thought to modify the project and present a solution in this project. This project is developed to enable interaction b/w user and projector screen.
